# Pi-Sony-A6000-remote

Using a Raspberry Pi to control a Sony A6000 camera, using an IR led on gpio pin 36.

Copy the *.py and the *.jpg files into /home/pi/

For the RMT-DSLR2 switch the camera into Remote Ctrl, for RMT-VP1 you need the VP1 receiver plugged in the camera.

Note LOCK will work on the VP1, put the camera in BULB mode, click above the shutter button to start and below the shutter button to stop exposure.

At your own risk !!
